\section{TC4MC}

TC4MC (Torque Control File for MotorController) Is the data storage format used to store torque information about a given track. This enables a more accurate simulation on the rolling road. 

The format is based on the DF4RR-Format with a few changes:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Instead of "shell eco marathon" header in the first row, first coloum, it must be "eco shell marathon torque".
	\item  The two data coloums "Torque" and "Distance" must be present.
\end{itemize}
