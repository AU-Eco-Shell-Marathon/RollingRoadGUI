Onion Architecture was used for overall design, this allows multiple frontends, so if the User Story 8 was to be developed, no refactoring would be required to the already existing business logic. The main namespaces can be seen in figure \vref{fig:Namespaces}, excluding testing namespaces.

Included in the Onion Architecture is the Repository Pattern, allowing for ao quick change from an in-memory database to an external if needed.
